### React Developer at [@webdoxclm](https://twitter.com/webdoxclm)

> Hello and welcome to my **healthy** digital fingerprint on internet

<br>

My name is Noel and I'm a react developer located in Mexico focused on the performance of the web and a passionate learner in that matter.
I've worked mainly in React but I'm a truly believer in technologies such as Next.js, Remix and Astro

### Beliefs

- <u>**Privacy is not optional, it's an obligation**</u>

### Interests / Learning

- Javascript vanilla (I need that practical part)
- How does a JS engine works? I've think about that since Bun.sh came out
- Learn a low level programming language, I would like Rust tho
- DevOps workflow and cloud. I'm a newbie but I already started with some sample projects

Maybe someday I write about my learning on that topics (￣ ▽ ￣)ノ, who knows...
